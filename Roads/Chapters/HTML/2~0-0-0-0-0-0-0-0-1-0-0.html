<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>You’ve made it to the end of the second project – good job! Along the way you practiced some valuable skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use <code class="language-swift">SKSpriteNode</code> to draw graphics to the screen.</li>
<li>How to use Z position to draw one node above others.</li>
<li>How to use <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> to animate changes to nodes.</li>
<li>How to use an <code class="language-swift">SKLabelNode</code> to show scores on the screen.</li>
<li>How to use an <code class="language-swift">SKAudioNode</code> to play looping music, and <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> to play one-off sounds.</li>
<li>How to present new scenes after a delay.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, you’ve learned a lot, and you’ve got a finished game you can carry on developing further. Even better, it was a game you helped shape with each choice you made along the way – if you feel like it, you could even go back through this project and make different choices to see how your game could have turned out!</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Here are some ways you could take this game further if you fancy pushing your skills:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using your new-found knowledge of <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code>, can you make the grid animals fade in when they are created, rather than just appearing?</li>
<li>We added a cap on <code class="language-swift">itemToShow</code> so the player can’t go beyond a certain level, but can you modify the code so they actually win rather than just continuing?</li>
<li>The game timer always uses white text. Can you adjust it so that it becomes red when the player is running low on time?</li>
</ol>
