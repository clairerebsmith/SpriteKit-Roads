<h1>Your mission: stay alive!</h1>
<p>As long as the player manages to avoid the walls, we’re going to award them points. </p>
<p>Writing this code takes three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a <code class="language-swift">scoreLabel</code> property that displays the player’s score on the screen.</li>
<li>Adding a <code class="language-swift">score</code> property that tracks the player’s actual score number, e.g. 150.</li>
<li>Adding to the score as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding a score label is done using a new type of SpriteKit node called <code class="language-swift">SKLabelNode</code>. You give these a font name, color, and size, and it will render any text you want. Just like sprite nodes and emitter nodes, label nodes also have a position on the screen, but you can also make them align their text left, right, or center (the default).</p>
<p>iOS comes with a huge range of fonts built in (see <a href="http://iosfonts.com/">http://iosfonts.com/</a> for the list), but we’re going to use Avenir Condensed Bold here – it looks pretty good by default.</p>
<p>We need to store our score label in a property so we can modify it later on, so please start by adding this before the <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let scoreLabel = SKLabelNode(fontNamed: "AvenirNextCondensed-Bold")</code></pre>
<p>Inside the <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> method we need to make a few adjustments to that score label. Specifically, we want to give it a Z position of 2 so that it sits above both the player and the walls, but we also want to adjust its Y coordinate so that it’s near the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Add these three lines to <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">scoreLabel.zPosition = 2
scoreLabel.position.y = 300
addChild(scoreLabel)</code></pre>
<p>Don’t run the game just yet – you won’t see the score label, because we haven’t given it any text yet.</p>
<p>To fix that we’re going to add a second property called <code class="language-swift">score</code>, which will hold the actual numeric value of the player’s score. </p>
<p>Swift has a neat syntactic feature called property observers, which let us run some code whenever a property’s value changes. In this game, we’re going to add a property observer to the new <code class="language-swift">score</code> property so that it automatically updates the text inside <code class="language-swift">scoreLabel</code>.</p>
<p>Add this new property below <code class="language-swift">scoreLabel</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">var score = 0 {
    didSet {
        scoreLabel.text = "SCORE: \(score)"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-swift">\(score)</code> syntax is string interpolation, which is a fancy way of saying “put the value of <code class="language-swift">score</code> into this string.”</p>
<p>Now that the score label will get updated whenever the <code class="language-swift">score</code> property is set, we can give it some initial text by adding one more line to <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">score = 0</code></pre>
<p>Even though <code class="language-swift">score</code> was already set to 0, that still causes the <code class="language-swift">didSet</code> property observer to be run, which in turn updates the score label’s text. So, if you run the game now you should see “SCORE: 0” at the top.</p>
<p>Now that we have the ability to track and show the player’s score, the last step is easy: we just need to modify the <code class="language-swift">score</code> property as play progresses.</p>
<p>The <code class="language-swift">update()</code> method is called every time the game is about to render a new frame, i.e. draw our game to the iPad screen, which makes that the perfect place for incrementing the score.</p>
<p>In fact, all we need to do is write one line of code to complete this step. Add this to the <code class="language-swift">update()</code> method now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">score += 1</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! Go ahead and run the game now, and you should see the score continually going up.</p><ul><li><a href="1~0-2-0-0-1-2-0-2-0-x-x-x.html">Go to next chapter</a></li></ul>
