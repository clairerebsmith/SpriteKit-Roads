<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this project you’re going to build a game similar to Flappy Bird – <em>how</em> similar depends on the choices you make along the way, of course.</p>
<p>In this project you’re going to be using parallax scrolling, which is a time-honored technique to create the feeling of depth in 2D games. It works by making different parts of the background scroll at different speeds, and even though it’s fairly trivial to code I think you’ll find the effect looks great!</p>
<p>All the projects in this book start with the same blank SpriteKit template project, DiveIntoSpriteKit. It doesn’t add anything special – in fact, it’s just the basic Xcode project with all the unnecessary extras deleted so that you have a completely blank slate.</p>
<p>So, take a copy of that project now, call it Project3, then open it in Xcode.</p>
<p>Now it’s time for your first choice. Do you want to make Crashy Plane, Sinky Sub, or Bumpy Balloon?</p>
