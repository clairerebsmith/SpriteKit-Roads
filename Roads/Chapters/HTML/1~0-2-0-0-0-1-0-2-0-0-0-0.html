<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>You’ve made it to the end of the first project – good job! Along the way you practiced some valuable skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use <code class="language-swift">SKSpriteNode</code> to draw graphics to the screen.</li>
<li>How to use Z position to draw one node above others.</li>
<li>How particle systems can be used to provide special effects like fire, smoke, and dust.</li>
<li>How to use Core Motion to let the user control the game by tilting their device.</li>
<li>How to use the <code class="language-swift">Timer</code> class to run code at regular intervals.</li>
<li>How to use <code class="language-swift">Int.random(in:)</code> to generate random numbers in a specific range.</li>
<li>How to create physics bodies out of textures.</li>
<li>How to use contact test and category bitmasks to control physics interactions.</li>
<li>How to use an <code class="language-swift">SKLabelNode</code> to show scores on the screen.</li>
<li>How to use an <code class="language-swift">SKAudioNode</code> to play looping music, and <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> to play one-off sounds.</li>
<li>How to present new scenes after a delay.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, you’ve learned a lot, and you’ve got a finished game you can carry on developing further. Even better, it was a game you helped shape with each choice you made along the way – if you feel like it, you could even go back through this project and make different choices to see how your game could have turned out!</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Here are three ways you could take this game further if you fancy pushing your skills:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make multiple enemies, randomly chosen. Each time <code class="language-swift">createEnemy()</code> is called we always created the same enemy, but with a little input from <code class="language-swift">Int.random(in:)</code> it wouldn’t be hard to select one from several possible enemy graphics.</li>
<li>Try to refactor <code class="language-swift">createEnemy()</code> and <code class="language-swift">createBonus()</code> into a single method to avoid code duplication.</li>
<li>Make it so that tapping the screen causes the player’s motorbike to fire a weapon at the barrels. Perhaps make their number of shots limited, then using <code class="language-swift">Timer</code> to add one reload every few seconds.</li>
</ol>
