<h1>Make smart moves to win</h1>
<p>In this game the player score points by tilting the screen a little as possible, which means if they are constantly making massive movements they won’t get a very high score.</p>
<p>Writing this code takes three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a <code class="language-swift">scoreLabel</code> property that displays the player’s score on the screen.</li>
<li>Adding a <code class="language-swift">score</code> property that tracks the player’s actual score number, e.g. 150.</li>
<li>Adding to the score as needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adding a score label is done using a new type of SpriteKit node called <code class="language-swift">SKLabelNode</code>. You give these a font name, color, and size, and it will render any text you want. Just like sprite nodes and emitter nodes, label nodes also have a position on the screen, but you can also make them align their text left, right, or center (the default).</p>
<p>iOS comes with a huge range of fonts built in (see <a href="http://iosfonts.com/">http://iosfonts.com/</a> for the list), but we’re going to use Avenir Condensed Bold here – it looks pretty good by default.</p>
<p>We need to store our score label in a property so we can modify it later on, so please start by adding this before the <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let scoreLabel = SKLabelNode(fontNamed: "AvenirNextCondensed-Bold")</code></pre>
<p>Inside the <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> method we need to make a few adjustments to that score label. Specifically, we want to give it a Z position of 2 so that it sits above both the player and the barrels, but we also want to adjust its Y coordinate so that it’s near the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Add these three lines to <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">scoreLabel.zPosition = 2
scoreLabel.position.y = 300
addChild(scoreLabel)</code></pre>
<p>Don’t run the game just yet – you won’t see the score label, because we haven’t given it any text yet.</p>
<p>To fix that we’re going to add a second property called <code class="language-swift">score</code>, which will hold the actual numeric value of the player’s score. </p>
<p>Swift has a neat syntactic feature called property observers, which let us run some code whenever a property’s value changes. In this game, we’re going to add a property observer to the new <code class="language-swift">score</code> property so that it automatically updates the text inside <code class="language-swift">scoreLabel</code>.</p>
<p>Add this new property below <code class="language-swift">scoreLabel</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">var score = 0 {
    didSet {
        scoreLabel.text = "SCORE: \(score)"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-swift">\(score)</code> syntax is string interpolation, which is a fancy way of saying “put the value of <code class="language-swift">score</code> into this string.”</p>
<p>Now that the score label will get updated whenever the <code class="language-swift">score</code> property is set, we can give it some initial text by adding one more line to <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">score = 0</code></pre>
<p>Even though <code class="language-swift">score</code> was already set to 0, that still causes the <code class="language-swift">didSet</code> property observer to be run, which in turn updates the score label’s text. So, if you run the game now you should see “SCORE: 0” at the top.</p>
<p>Now that we have a score number and a score label, it’s time to modify that score based on the player’s movement.</p>
<p>Inside the <code class="language-swift">update()</code> method we already have constants called <code class="language-swift">changeX</code> and <code class="language-swift">changeY</code>, and we can use those to calculate whether to increment the player’s score. How generous you are is down to you, but I found it about right to award points if the player is moving less than 2 points in any direction.</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind that X and Y movement can be both positive and negative, so we want anything less than -2 and anything more than +2 to be counted as movement. The easiest way to work around this is by using the <code class="language-swift">abs()</code> function, which makes negative numbers positive and does nothing to positive numbers.</p>
<p>So, we can check for very little tilt movement by putting <code class="language-swift">changeX()</code> through <code class="language-swift">abs()</code>, putting <code class="language-swift">changeY</code> through <code class="language-swift">abs()</code>, adding the two together, and seeing whether it’s less than or equal to 2. If it is, we’ll add 1 to the <code class="language-swift">score</code> property, which in turn will update the score label.</p>
<p>Add this code to the <code class="language-swift">update()</code> method, just before the player’s position is updated:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">if abs(changeX) + abs(changeY) &lt;= 2 {
    score += 1
}</code></pre>
<p>That’s everything we need to keep track of scores, so go ahead and try out the game now!</p><ul><li><a href="1~0-2-0-0-0-1-0-0-0-x-x-x.html">Go to next chapter</a></li></ul>
