<h1>Drawing a background</h1>
<p>In this game we’re going to show the player a grid of aliens for them to zap. Each of the aliens will be a different color, which is where the challenge comes in: tapping groups of 3 will earn some points, 4 will earn more points, 5 will earn even <em>more</em> points, and so on. Later on, we’ll even <em>penalize</em> the player if they select only 1 item, which stops them from just tapping the screen wildly.</p>
<p>First things first, though: we need to place a background image to go behind the aliens. I’ve provided a picture for the background in the assets for this project, which should set the scene nicely.</p>
<p>To add this to your project, you need to open Xcode’s project navigator by pressing Cmd+1, then look for the file Assets.xcassets. Select that, and you’ll see “AppIcon” is already there. Now for the important part: find night@2x.png in the files for this project that came with this book, and drag it just below AppIcon in your asset catalog. This adds it to your project so you can use it in the game.</p>
<p>While you’re there, you might as well copy in the alien images too, so please copy in all the images that start with 'alien' – alien-blue@2x.png, and so on.</p>
<p>Now that it’s in the project, the next step is to draw the night on the screen by adding our first code to the GameScene.swift file. This comes with a few empty methods built-in, but for now I’d like you to focus on the <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> method. This gets called when your game has just finished loading and you can go ahead and configure it however you need.</p>
<p>This method is the perfect place for us to create our background image, so I’d like to introduce you to <code class="language-swift">SKSpriteNode</code>: SpriteKit’s way of loading and drawing images to the screen. We want to load our background image, so we can create the sprite node just by using its name – “night”.</p>
<p>We don’t need to position it here because the background image is the same size as the screen, but <em>do</em> need to set its Z position. This controls in which order layers are drawn, which in turn decides whether one layer is drawn above or below another. In this case we’re going to give the background a Z position of -2, which will put it behind everything we’ll add later.</p>
<p>Add this code to the <code class="language-swift">didMove(to:)</code> method now:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let background = SKSpriteNode(imageNamed: "night")
background.zPosition = -2
addChild(background)</code></pre>
<p>Press Cmd+R to build and run your game now, and you should see the night background filling the screen. It’s nice that it works, but it’s hardly exciting – let’s get on to making a grid of aliens…</p><ul><li><a href="4~0-2-0-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Go to next chapter</a></li></ul>
