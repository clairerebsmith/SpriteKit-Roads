<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>That’s the end of the fourth project, and I hope you feel you’ve learned a lot! In this project you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drew sprites on the screen with <code class="language-swift">SKSpriteNode</code>.</li>
<li>Added animation with <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code>.</li>
<li>Played looping audio with <code class="language-swift">SKAudioNode</code>.</li>
<li>Drew text with <code class="language-swift">SKLabelNode</code>.</li>
<li>Read screen touches and looked up what nodes were tapped.</li>
<li>Used GCD to launch a new game after some time has passed.</li>
</ul>
<p>And more – you should be proud of your progress!</p>
<p>Match three games are hugely popular around the world, and hopefully you already have a few ideas how you could make this better. If not, here are some homework ideas to get you started…</p>
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>For an easy challenge, try adding extra moves for the player if they manage to match 16 items all at once.</p>
<p>For something more challenging, stop the music when the game ends. This is best done by making our background music into a property, then calling <code class="language-swift">run()</code> on it with the action <code class="language-swift">SKAction.stop()</code> inside <code class="language-swift">endGame()</code>.</p>
<p>And for a real mental work out, see if you can write a method that recommends a move to players if press a Hint button. A simple way of implementing this would be to check the match count for all items in the grid, then show a yellow square over the item with the most matches.</p>
