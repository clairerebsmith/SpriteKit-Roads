<h1>Changing balloon colors</h1>
<p>If they player chooses to match only one balloon, we’re going to penalize them by completely changing all the balloon colors, effectively resetting the game grid.</p>
<p>Changing our balloons is actually quite easy, because each sprite node has a <code class="language-swift">texture</code> property that contains its image. SpriteKit textures are handled using a class called <code class="language-swift">SKTexture</code>, and you can create them just like creating an <code class="language-swift">SKSpriteNode</code> then assign them to an existing sprite node without having to delete and re-add it.</p>
<p>Here’s what we’re going to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an array of all the balloons image names we can use.</li>
<li>Loop over all column, and all items in each column.</li>
<li>Use a random image name for our new item name.</li>
<li>Create an <code class="language-swift">SKTexture</code> from that image name, and use that for our  item’s texture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Replace your current <code class="language-swift">penalizePlayer()</code> method with this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">func penalizePlayer() {
    let itemImages = ["balloon-black", "balloon-blue", "balloon-green", "balloon-purple", "balloon-red", "balloon-yellow", "balloon-orange"]

    for col in cols {
        for item in col {
            let changeTo = itemImages.randomElement()!
            item.name = changeTo
            item.texture = SKTexture(imageNamed: changeTo)
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it – try selecting a single balloon now and you should see the rest of the grid change!</p><ul><li><a href="4~0-1-0-0-0-2-0-0-1-0-x-x.html">Go to next chapter</a></li></ul>
