<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this first project we’re going to build a game that makes players stay alive. How that looks and works will be down to you, of course: you can have them avoiding asteroids in space, avoiding mines in the sea, or even avoiding cars on a highway.</p>
<p>Along the way you’ll also learn about particle effects, collision detection, and more – this project is a great way to dive into SpriteKit!</p>
<p>To get started we need to create a new project using the template for this book. This template doesn’t include any special code, but I have cleaned it completely so you’re starting with a completely blank slate each time. So, take a copy of my DiveIntoSpriteKit template and call it “Project1”, then it open it in Xcode.</p>
<p>It’s now time for your first choice. Do you want the player to fly through space, swim through the sea, or race on roads?</p>
<h2>Please make your choice:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="1~0-0-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Fly through space</a></li>
<li><a href="1~0-1-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Sail through the sea</a></li>
<li><a href="1~0-2-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Race on roads</a></li>
</ul>
