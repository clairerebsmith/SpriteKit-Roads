<h1>Wrap up</h1>
<p>You’ve completed the second project – well done! Alongside having a finished game to play, you also practiced some useful skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to use <code class="language-swift">SKSpriteNode</code> to draw graphics to the screen.</li>
<li>How to use Z position to draw one node above others.</li>
<li>How particle systems can be used to provide special effects like fire, smoke, and dust.</li>
<li>How to scroll background sprites at different speed to create the illusion of depth.</li>
<li>How to let the player control their submarine by tapping the screen.</li>
<li>How to use the <code class="language-swift">Timer</code> class to run code at regular intervals.</li>
<li>How to make Swift generate random numbers in a specific range.</li>
<li>How to create physics bodies out of textures.</li>
<li>How to use contact test and category bitmasks to control physics interactions.</li>
<li>How to use an <code class="language-swift">SKLabelNode</code> to show scores on the screen.</li>
<li>How to use an <code class="language-swift">SKAudioNode</code> to play looping music, and <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> to play one-off sounds.</li>
<li>How to present new scenes after a delay.</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<p>One interesting technique you met this time was using invisible collision rectangles to track score. As you saw, this is just a neat way of re-using code you already know, and it means SpriteKit takes on most of the work</p>
<p>In short, you’ve come on a long way, and you’ve got a finished game you can carry on developing further. Even better, it was a game you helped shape with each choice you made along the way – if you feel like it, you could even go back through this project and make different choices to see how your game could have turned out!</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Here are three ways you could take this game further if you fancy pushing your skills:</p>
<ol>
<li>Show a game over sprite node when the player dies. I’ve provided gameOver@2x.png for just this purpose – add it to your asset catalog, then add it to the scene when the player dies. For bonus points try experimenting with <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> to make it animate!</li>
<li>Create a new particle system that’s permanently attached to the player’s submarine. With a little creative work in the particle editor you can add a convincing wave effect behind the submarine.</li>
<li>If you’re looking for a challenging task, keep track of how many mine you’ve created, then for every 10 call <code class="language-swift">invalidate()</code> on the <code class="language-swift">timer</code> property and re-create it with a shorter time interval so that mine get created faster.</li>
</ol>
<p>That brings us to the end of this project – <a href="toc.html">click here to return to the table of contents</a>.</p>
