<h1>When they guess correctly</h1>
<p>When the user taps the correct item in our grid we’ll make the wrong balls fade away then level up.</p>
<p>This takes two steps: write code to respond to taps and decide whether they were right or wrong, then of course make the wrong balls fade away to celebrate.</p>
<p>Our project has an empty <code class="language-swift">touchesBegan()</code> method, which is the perfect place to figure out whether the user touched the right or wrong answer. We’ll be given a set containing their screen touches and it’s our job to figure out what got tapped in our game.</p>
<p>Sets are like arrays that contain each item only once, and it’s used here because the iPad supports multi-touch. It’s possible the user might touch multiple things at the same time, although we don’t need that here.</p>
<p>So, we’ll start by fetching the first touch that got passed to us. Add this to <code class="language-swift">touchesBegan()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">guard let touch = touches.first else { return }</code></pre>
<p>That assigns the first touch (a <code class="language-swift">UITouch</code> object) to the <code class="language-swift">touch</code> constant. Next we must find where that touch is in our scene, and <code class="language-swift">UITouch</code> has a method for that called <code class="language-swift">location(in:)</code> – we’ll pass it <code class="language-swift">self</code> so that it checks the current scene.</p>
<p>Add this below the previous line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let location = touch.location(in: self)</code></pre>
<p>Next we need the list of SpriteKit nodes at that location. This is also one line of code because our game scene has a <code class="language-swift">nodes(at:)</code> method to do just that. We’ll pass it our touch’s location, and it will return all the nodes that are there.</p>
<p>Add this line next:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let tappedNodes = nodes(at: location)</code></pre>
<p>We now know which nodes were tapped, but that includes <em>all</em> nodes under the user’s finger. For us that will always include the background, and might also include one of our balls. SpriteKit sorts this array by Z position, so nodes that are towards the top (like our balls) come before nodes that are towards the bottom (like our background).</p>
<p>This means we can read the first node from <code class="language-swift">tappedNodes</code> and check whether its name is “correct” or “wrong” – SpriteKit will ensure that’s one of our balls rather than the background, unless of course the user tapped an empty area of the grid.</p>
<p>Add this to <code class="language-swift">touchesBegan()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">guard let tapped = tappedNodes.first else { return }

if tapped.name == "correct" {
    print("Correct!")
} else if tapped.name == "wrong" {
    print("Wrong!")
}</code></pre>
<p>Try the game to make sure everything works – Xcode’s log should print “Wrong!” or “Correct!” depending on what you tap.</p>
<p>That’s not much fun, so let’s move on and make the wrong balls fade away.</p>
<p>First, create a method called <code class="language-swift">correctAnswer()</code>, after <code class="language-swift">touchesBegan()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">func correctAnswer(node: SKNode) {
}</code></pre>
<p>I’ve made that accept the node that was tapped so we can position things around it. Next, replace <code class="language-swift">print("Correct!")</code> with a call to that method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">if tapped.name == "correct" {
    correctAnswer(node: tapped)</code></pre>
<p>Now all we need to do is fill in the <code class="language-swift">correctAnswer()</code> method with code to make wrong balls fade away.</p>
<p>Fading out objects is best done using <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code>, which is SpriteKit’s way of performing animations over time. In this case, we’ll use <code class="language-swift">fadeOut(withDuration:)</code> to make the wrong balls fade over over half a second.</p>
<p>Start by adding this code to <code class="language-swift">correctAnswer()</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let fade = SKAction.fadeOut(withDuration: 0.5)

for child in children {
    guard child.name == "wrong" else { continue }
    child.run(fade)
}</code></pre>
<p>Just checking the <code class="language-swift">name</code> property for the string “wrong” is enough to ensure only wrong answers fade away.</p>
<p>Next we need to make the player level up. The fade out takes place over 0.5 seconds, so we’re going to write some code that adjusts the level after 1 second. That should mean a 0.5 second fade, then a 0.5 second wait, then a level change.</p>
<p>iOS has a framework called Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) that lets us run code after a delay: we tell it when our code should run by adding a number of seconds to the current time, and it does the rest.</p>
<p>There’s one catch: if we use any properties or methods from our <code class="language-swift">GameScene</code> class, we need to prefix them with <code class="language-swift">self.</code> otherwise Xcode complains. There’s no other work to do, and in fact Xcode complains so much that you have no choice, so I wouldn’t worry too much.</p>
<p>Put this just after the end of the loop you just added:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 1) {
    self.level += 1
    self.createLevel()
}</code></pre>
<p>Try the game now and you should find all the wrong balls fade out when you tap the correct one.</p>
<p>To make things more interesting, we can use <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> sequences to scale up the correct answer, then scale it back down. An <code class="language-swift">SKAction</code> sequence is made up of an array of individual actions that run one after the other, so we can get the desired effect by putting this code at the end of the <code class="language-swift">correctAnswer()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-swift">let scaleUp = SKAction.scale(to: 2, duration: 0.5)
let scaleDown = SKAction.scale(to: 1, duration: 0.5)
let sequence = SKAction.sequence([scaleUp, scaleDown])
node.run(sequence)</code></pre>
<p>Now, your next choice: what should happen if they get the answer <em>wrong</em>? </p>
