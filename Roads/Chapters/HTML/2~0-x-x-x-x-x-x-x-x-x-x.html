<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this project you’re going to build a puzzle game that asks users to study a grid of similar items closely and select the correct answer. What kind of items they see and what makes for a correct answer will be down to you – is it a grid of animals where one appears only once, a grid of numbered balls where they need to find the highest number, or a grid of lights where only one flashed?</p>
<p>To get started we need to create a new project using the template for this book. This template doesn’t include any special code, but I have cleaned it completely so you’re starting with a completely blank slate each time. So, take a copy of my DiveIntoSpriteKit template and call it “Project2”, then it open it in Xcode.</p>
<p>It’s now time for your first choice. Should the user see a grid of animals and tap the odd one out, should they see a grid of lights and tap the one that didn’t flash, or should they see a grid of numbered balls and tap whichever one has the highest number?</p>
<h2>Please make your choice:</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="2~0-0-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Spot the odd one out</a></li>
<li><a href="2~0-1-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Tap the light that didn't flash</a></li>
<li><a href="2~0-2-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x.html">Tap the highest-numbered ball</a></li>
</ul>
